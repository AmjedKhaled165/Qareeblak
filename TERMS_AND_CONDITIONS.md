# Terms and Conditions for Qareeblak Marketplace

**Last Updated: February 2026**

## 1. The Platform and Our Role
Qareeblak (the "Platform") acts as a digital intermediary and marketplace connecting independent service providers ("Providers") with users seeking services ("Customers"). **Qareeblak does not provide the services themselves.** We are an application that facilitates the booking, communication, and payment between two independent parties.

## 2. Independent Service Providers
Providers are independent contractors, not employees, partners, or agents of Qareeblak. Each Provider is solely responsible for:
- The quality, safety, and legality of the services provided.
- Maintaining any necessary licenses, permits, or insurance.
- Complying with all local labor and tax laws.
Qareeblak does not guarantee the performance of any Provider and is not responsible for their conduct or omissions.

## 3. Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law, Qareeblak and its owners shall not be liable for:
- Any direct, indirect, or incidental damages resulting from the service performed by a Provider.
- Physical injury, property damage, or delays caused during service delivery.
- Technical failures of the app that may result in missed appointments or data loss.
- Any disputes arising between a Customer and a Provider.

## 4. Refund and Cancellation Policy
- Cancellations made within **2 hours** of the scheduled appointment may be subject to a cancellation fee.
- Refunds are handled case-by-case. Since the service is delivered by independent parties, Qareeblak can only facilitate a refund if the Provider agrees or if the service was demonstrably not delivered.
- Admin fees and delivery charges are generally non-refundable.

## 5. Dispute Resolution
In the event of a disagreement between a Customer and a Provider, both parties agree to first attempt to resolve the issue through our in-app Complaints System. If a resolution cannot be reached, Qareeblak may, at its sole discretion, act as an informal mediator but is not legally obligated to resolve the dispute.

## 6. User Conduct
By using this Platform, you agree not to:
- Bypass the Platform to book services directly with a Provider discovered through Qareeblak.
- Provide false information or fraudulent payment methods.
- Harass, abuse, or engage in suspicious behavior towards Providers or other Users.

**By continuing to use Qareeblak, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to these terms.**
