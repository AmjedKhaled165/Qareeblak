# Task: Filter Couriers for Supervisors

## Status
- [ ] Update `src/app/partner/orders/create/page.tsx` to filter couriers by supervisor ID.
- [ ] Verify filtering works for supervisors (only assigned couriers shown).
- [ ] Verify functionality remains unchanged for owners (all couriers shown).

## Details
- Supervisors should only see the couriers they are explicitly assigned to when creating an order.
- Owners should continue to see all couriers.
